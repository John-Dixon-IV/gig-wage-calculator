The apps tell you one story: *"You made $120 today. Nice work!"*

Your bank account tells another: the gas receipts, the oil changes, the endless miles on your car, and the unpaid dead time between orders.

That gap between what the apps say you earn and what you actually take home is exactly why [GigWageCalc.com](/) exists.

This guide walks you through, step by step, how to calculate your true hourly wage as a gig worker—and why Uber, DoorDash, and other platforms have zero incentive to help you do this math.

## Step 1: Start With What the Apps Want You to See

Open your Uber, DoorDash, or other gig app and look at:

- Total gross earnings for a period (day/week/month)
- Total online time or active hours
- Number of trips/deliveries

This is the number the apps love to show you:

> "You made $25/hour today!"

But that's **gross, not net**. It's marketing, not reality.

For now, write down:

- **Gross earnings** (what the app says you earned)
- **Total hours online** (or your best estimate if you track manually)

You'll use these as your starting point.

## Step 2: Count All the Time You're Actually Working

The apps often count "active time" (time on a trip/order), not the time:

- Sitting in a parking lot waiting for a ping
- Driving to a hot zone
- Declining trash orders
- Sitting at a restaurant waiting for food to be ready

If you only count "active time," your hourly wage will look inflated.

For a real hourly wage, you need:

- **Time from when you start your shift to when you stop**
- Including: waiting, driving to zones, drive-backs home

**Action:** On your next few shifts, use your phone's clock or a time-tracking app to measure start of shift to end of shift (door to door). That's your real work time.

## Step 3: Subtract the Big, Obvious Costs (Gas Is Just the Beginning)

Most drivers only think about gas. But you're running a mini business, and every mile costs you money.

Your major ongoing expenses include:

- **Gas** — The most obvious cost, and it adds up fast.
- **Maintenance** — Oil changes, brakes, tires, alignments, fluids.
- **Repairs** — Wear and tear from constant driving means things break sooner.
- **Depreciation** — Your car loses value faster because you're piling on miles.
- **Insurance** — Personal plus any commercial/gig coverage you carry.
- **Car washes & cleaning** — Especially for rideshare.

At [GigWageCalc.com](/), we bundle these into a cost-per-mile estimate based on your car type and local prices. But you can approximate it yourself:

1. Estimate your average cost per mile (a common range is **$0.30–$0.70 per mile** depending on your vehicle and location).
2. Multiply that by your total work miles (miles driven for gig work, including dead miles with no passenger/order).

**Cost per mile x total gig miles = total vehicle cost**

## Step 4: Don't Ignore the "Invisible" Costs

There are also less obvious, but very real, costs that eat your income:

- **Unpaid wait time** — You're still working even when the app is silent.
- **Health and safety** — No paid sick days, no benefits, no worker's comp.
- **Phone + data** — You need a solid smartphone and lots of data to stay online.
- **Tolls, parking, tickets** — Often not fully reimbursed, if at all.
- **Self-employment tax** — As a contractor, you pay both sides of payroll taxes.
- **Opportunity cost** — Hours spent chasing $10/hour net could be spent somewhere better.

You may not assign a dollar value to all of these right away, but they matter when you're deciding: *"Is this really worth it for me?"*

[GigWageCalc.com](/) is designed to help you factor in as many of these hidden costs as possible so you aren't flying blind.

## Step 5: Do the Core Math — Your True Hourly Wage

Here's the basic formula you should be using:

1. Start with your **gross earnings** for the period.
2. Subtract your **total expenses** (vehicle costs + other gig-related costs).
3. Divide by your **total hours worked** (not just "active" time).

> **True Hourly Wage = (Gross Earnings - Total Expenses) / Total Hours Worked**

**A quick example:**

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Gross earnings for the week | $800 |
| Total gig miles | 600 miles |
| Cost per mile | $0.40 |
| Vehicle cost (600 x $0.40) | $240 |
| Other costs (phone, supplies, etc.) | $40 |
| **Total expenses** | **$280** |
| Total hours worked (door to door) | 40 hours |

Now plug it in:

- **Net income** = $800 - $280 = **$520**
- **True hourly wage** = $520 / 40 = **$13/hour**

The app might tell you that you "made $20/hour." Reality: after costs, you're at **$13/hour**—and that's before health insurance or any benefits.

## Step 6: Use GigWageCalc.com to Run the Numbers for You

Doing this by hand every week is a pain. That's why [GigWageCalc.com](/) exists.

On GigWageCalc.com, you can:

- Select your platform (Uber, DoorDash, etc.)
- Enter your gross earnings, hours worked, miles driven, and vehicle type / estimated cost per mile
- Optionally add extra costs (phone, tolls, car washes) and local details that affect your expenses

The calculator does the math and shows you:

- **Your true hourly wage**
- **How much you're effectively losing to expenses**
- **How far you are from a living wage** in your area

You can then use that to decide:

- Is this platform worth it?
- Should you work fewer/more hours?
- Are there better times/areas to drive?
- Do you need to raise your minimum order/ride standards?

## Step 7: Compare Platforms, Cities, and Strategies

Once you know your real hourly wage, you unlock real power:

**Compare platforms** — Is Uber actually better than DoorDash for you—or just louder in its marketing?

**Compare zones and times** — Maybe your Saturday night is profitable, but weekdays are a loss after costs.

**Compare cities** — A $20/hour gross in a high-cost city with high maintenance/gas prices may net you less than $15/hour gross in a cheaper market.

With [GigWageCalc.com](/), you can rerun your numbers anytime your strategy changes and see instantly whether you're moving toward a sustainable income—or away from it.

## Why This Matters: The Apps Won't Do This For You

Uber, DoorDash, and the rest have billions of reasons not to make this calculation easy.

If every driver saw their true hourly wage:

- Fewer people would sign up.
- More drivers would quit.
- More would demand fair pay and protections.

That's why the burden falls on workers to track their numbers, understand their costs, and protect themselves from a model designed to hide the real math.

## Take Back Control: Calculate Your True Wage Today

If you're driving or delivering and only looking at what the app flashes on your screen, you're playing their game with their rules. It's time to flip that.

1. Gather your last week or month of **earnings, hours, and miles**.
2. Head to [GigWageCalc.com](/).
3. Plug in your numbers.
4. Look at your true hourly wage—and ask yourself honestly: *"Is this work paying me what I'm worth?"*

If the answer is no, you're not alone. But you're also not powerless.

**Knowledge is the first step.** GigWageCalc.com gives you the numbers. What you do with them is up to you.
